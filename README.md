## Run the Docker Image

Build:  `docker build -t my-apache .`
Run:    Use the Docker Desktop GUI and make sure to set the environment variables.
Access: [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

## Sensitive information

Make sure to never commit sensitive information you might have in your `env.php` file. This file is used to set environment variables when developing locally.

## Database

During development, we are going to act as if the database is ephemeral. This means that you should not rely on the data in the application, it should always be generated by the application itself. To set the schema of the database, please edit the `database/create.php` file. If you want to add data to the database, please edit the `database/dummies.php` file. To make it run, visit the address `/database/create.php` in your browser. To reset the database, visit the address `/database/reset.php` in your browser.

This approach makes it easier to make sure we have a consistent database schema and data across all developers.

## Component-like Structure

To apply the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, the code is structured in components. Each page should use the layout by declaring a `renderPage())` function that returns the HTML content. The layout is defined in the `layout.php` file.
