## Run the Docker Image

Build:  `docker build -t my-apache .`
Run:    Use the Docker Desktop GUI and make sure to set the environment variables.
You can see the ENV variables you have to set in the `public/env.php` file.
Access: [http://localhost/](http://localhost/)

## Run with XAMPP

1. Clone the repository in the `htdocs` folder of your XAMPP installation.
2. Set the environment variables in the `public/env.php` file. (just change the database name to whatever you have)
3. Set the document root of your Apache server to the `public` folder of the repository. (You can do this by editing the `httpd.conf` file of Apache, accessible through the XAMPP control panel > Apache > Config > httpd.conf)
4. Start or Restart the Apache server.
5. Access the application through [http://localhost/](http://localhost/)

## Database: How to init

During development, we are going to act as if the database is ephemeral. This means that you should not rely on the data in the database, it should always be generated by the application itself. To set the schema of the database, please edit the `database/create.php` file. If you want to add data to the database, please edit the `database/dummies.php` file. To make initialize the database, visit the [http://localhost/database/create.php](http://localhost/database/create.php) page. This will create the database and fill it with dummy data. To reset the database, visit the [http://localhost/database/reset.php](http://localhost/database/reset.php) page. Make sure to reset the database after you have made changes to the `create.php` file. 

This approach makes it easier to make sure we have a consistent database schema and data across all developers.

## Sensitive information

Make sure to never commit sensitive information you might have in your `env.php` file. This file is used to set environment variables when developing locally.

## Component-like Structure

To apply the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, each page should use the layout by declaring a `renderPage())` function that returns the HTML content. The layout is defined in the `layout.php` file.
